title: All the waste we cannot see
---

In this little essay, I gather my thoughts about Over, a 42-feet wide composed image of a giant landfill.

There is something elusively captivating about the work, and even more so about the artist and his process to bring it to life. There is, to begin with, the image itself. The scale is... big; so much so that discarded fighter jets look exactly like the tiny toy replicas we'd play with as kids. Except they appear in full size, relative to other items of waste next to them.

Also, a word about discarded fighter jets. We think of military jets as the flying beasts of war that they are, but what are they after theye are released from duty? They become garbage, and as refuse they most end up somewhere. Why, and how, did they end up in the middle of nowhere in the Arizonian dessert?

Back to the image, which is not one but many. It is a point in time, and also a timeline. An event unfolding. A single place made of several others. Each part is a reality that exist as a seemingly isolated landfill with its own specialized refuse: the figher jets in Arizona, the giant industrial tractors outside of Sao Paulo. But as they are brought together in time and space, the image is given the power of narrative. This image is magicked! It holds the power of narrative, and tells about the possible, inevitable futures that emerge directly from our current way of living.

The march of progress leaves behind a trail of...broken stuff. We know this; we have seen pollution and destruction, oil spills, deforestation, ruins.

And because this image is composed of –arranged from– many other images, and the techniques, tools and practices that bind those together, it is not true: it is a way to lie your way towards the truth.

Art doesn't have to be anything. Art is an emergent practice of humans who sense, feel, fear, desire and create, and art, too, is what they make. Over happens to be art that brings up questions
