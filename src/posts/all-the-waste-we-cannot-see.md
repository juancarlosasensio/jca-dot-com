title: All the waste we cannot (un)see
---

I've recently rewatched a video about artist Cassio Vasconcellos describing a piece he titled _Over_. In it he guides viewers into his process of insight and development of this aerial photograph of a massive landfill. And he does so with purpose and nothing in the way of righteousness. It's an image about our current reality and it's about The Future.

After rewatching the video, I started asking myself what about it has captivated me and what I seem to like in art, generally. I came upon a few thoughts I want to jot down here.

From a young age, I was discouraged from seeing and asking questions about what I saw. It is unfortunate and remarcable how quickly I learned to unsee. And to carry on in the manner that stirs little trouble, keeping the assembly lines of family, school, society and government running without a hiccup. Which means I also learned to move on from one thing to the next without stopping. To make life even more puzzling, there has always been a steady stream of events, sightings and experiences that are real and misunderstood, and which I promptly buried in that shadowy place that holds, amongst other treassures, inconvenient truths I've learned to unsee. The show of this mad world must go on.

And to carry on in the manner keeps the assembly lines of family, school, society and government running without a hiccup. Which means I also learned to move on from one thing to the next without stopping. To make matters more disconcerting, my life has never ceased to be entangled with events, sightings and experiences that are real and misunderstood, and which I have promptly buried in that shadowy place that holds, amongst other treassures, inconvenient truths I've learned to unsee. The show of this mad world must go on without hiccups or further questions.

Art, I have found, can help me remember to remember. Art today adapts to survive in a world saturated by new incoming images, and so it comes to be that art alone seldom does the trick. In order to yield its gifts, art requires that I stop. Long enough to consider what's in front of me and get to know it intimately, remembering. At first, stopping may seem like an act of resistance againts the modern world, but it is not. Our survival depends on it. We have more than 50,000 nuclear bombs and yet we can't stop making them. Even more stupendously stupid, we no longer have a use for pennies, yes the 1 cent coins, and yet we can't stop making those, either, event at a terrible loss.

Which means "stopping" is not only to stop the negative, but to allow the familiar to be considered anew. That is the beauty of Over. A landfill is a landfill, but/and what else is there when consider it from the view of flying bird and overstory? And what if many landfills are brought together into one single aerial image?

This image has captivated me because this image is magicked. Its stillnes shows a trajectory towards undesirable, inevitable futures. Its imaginary quality gives new meaning and significance to real landfills. It shows a landfill that doesn't exist, not yet. But it can. And it will?
