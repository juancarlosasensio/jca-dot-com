title: All the waste we cannot (un)see
---

I've recently rewatched a video about Cassio Vasconcellos' artwork _Over_. In it he guides viewers into his process of insight and technical development of this aerial photograph of a massive landfill. And he does so with purpose and nothing in the way of righteousness. It's an image about our current reality and it's about The Future.

After rewatching the video, I started asking myself what about it has captivated me, and what I like in art, generally speaking. I came upon a few thoughts I want to jot down here.

From a young age, I was discouraged from seeing and asking questions about what I saw. It is unfortunate and remarcable how quickly I learned to unsee. And to carry on in the manner that stirs little trouble, keeping the assembly lines of family, school, society and government running without a hiccup. Which means I also learned to move on from one thing to the next without stopping. To make life ever more puzzling, there has never ceased to be a steady stream of events, sightings and experiences that are real and misunderstood, and which I promptly filed into that shadowy place that holds, amongst other treassures, inconvenient truths I've learned to unsee. The show of this mad world must go on.

Art, I have found, can help me remember to remember. It must exist and survive in a world already saturated by new incoming images, and so it comes to be that art alone seldom does the trick. In order to yield its gifts, art requires that I stop. Long enough to consider what's in front of me and get to know it intimately, remembering. At first, stopping may seem like a resistance to modern life, but it is not. It is critical to you and me as individuals, and to the world at large. Our survival depends on it. We have more than 50,000 nuclear bombs and yet we can't stop making them.

Stopping need not be framed solely in the negative; _stopping to_ is just as powerful as _stopping from_. One experience stopping encourages is looking at what is already there and consider it in new ways. That is the beauty of Over. A landfill is a landfill, and yet what else is there when seen from the view of the flying bird and the overstory? And what if many landfills are brought together into one single aerial image?
