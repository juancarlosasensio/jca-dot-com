Hi, welcome to my nook on the world wide web. I'm glad you're here.

I’m working towards a better web for people and the planet. Currently, I'm building personal web infrastructures for individuals who want to be sane and online

My hope is to, one day, launch a microstudio to amplify this work. Stay tuned.
